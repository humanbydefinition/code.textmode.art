# Data Protection Policy

> This page is also available in [German](./datenschutz).

## Introduction

This website is a documentation project for the `textmode.js` library, which is a JavaScript library for applying real-time ASCII conversion to any HTML canvas.

This documentation is built with [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/) and is hosted on a Virtual Private Server *(VPS)* provided by Hetzner. Our application runs on a Coolify instance, which manages the necessary services for this application.

As service providers, Hetzner may collect certain technically necessary data *(including IP addresses)* in accordance with their privacy policy.

This website uses Umami for anonymous analytics. Umami is a privacy-friendly, cookie-less analytics solution that anonymizes all collected data and does not track users across websites.

## Analytics

We use Umami, a privacy-focused analytics tool, to collect anonymous usage statistics about our website. This helps us understand how users interact with our documentation and improve the user experience.

Umami does not use cookies and does not collect any personally identifiable information. All data is anonymized and we cannot identify individual users through this analytics tool.

The following anonymous data may be collected:
- Page views and referral sources
- Browser type and device information
- Country of origin (based on anonymized IP)
- Session duration and navigation paths

As Umami does not use cookies and does not collect personal data, consent for this type of analytics is not required under GDPR.

## No User Data Collection

This website is strictly an informational documentation site. We do not:
- Require user registration or authentication
- Collect any personal information from visitors
- Process or store any user-specific data
- Use cookies for tracking or personalization purposes

## Payment Services and Financial Support

When you choose to support the project financially, you may use third-party payment services. These services are operated independently and have their own privacy policies and terms of service.

### Third-Party Payment Providers

We offer the following payment options:

**Ko-fi** ([ko-fi.com](https://ko-fi.com))  
When you make a contribution through Ko-fi, you will be redirected to their platform. Ko-fi processes payments and may collect personal information such as your name, email address, and payment details. Please review [Ko-fi's Privacy Policy](https://ko-fi.com/home/privacy) for information about how they handle your data.

**GitHub Sponsors** ([github.com/sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors))  
When you sponsor through GitHub, you will be redirected to GitHub's platform. GitHub processes payments and may collect personal information. Please review [GitHub's Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement) for information about how they handle your data.

**Cryptocurrency (Ethereum & Tezos)**  
For cryptocurrency contributions, you interact directly with blockchain networks. We only provide wallet addresses and do not collect, process, or store any personal information related to cryptocurrency transactions. Blockchain transactions are public and pseudonymous by nature.

### What We Receive

When you make a contribution through Ko-fi or GitHub Sponsors, we may receive basic information such as your username or display name from these platforms. We do not request, collect, or store any additional personal information beyond what these platforms choose to share with us.

For cryptocurrency contributions, we only see the transaction on the public blockchain and cannot identify you unless you choose to contact us separately.

### No Data Storage

We do not store any payment information, credit card details, or financial data on our servers. All payment processing is handled exclusively by the third-party providers mentioned above.

## Your Rights

Under the GDPR, you have various rights regarding the processing of your personal data. However, since we do not collect or process any personal data beyond the anonymous analytics described above, most of these rights do not apply in practice to your use of this documentation site.

For any questions about our data practices, please contact us via email at [hello@textmode.art](mailto:hello@textmode.art).

The competent supervisory authority for data protection is: [Landesbeauftragte für Datenschutz und Informationsfreiheit Nordrhein-Westfalen](https://www.ldi.nrw.de/).

## Updates to this Privacy Policy

We reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy as necessary to comply with legal requirements or to reflect changes in our services. The updated Privacy Policy will be effective upon its publication on this website.
