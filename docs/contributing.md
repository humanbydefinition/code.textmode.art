# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in supporting `textmode.js`! The project is still in the process of opening up its codebase and documentation, so direct contributions *(pull requests, docs edits, etc.)* aren’t being accepted just yet.

That said, your feedback is incredibly valuable. If you’d like to help shape the project, please reach out through any of these channels:

- [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/humanbydefinition/textmode.js/issues) - bug reports and feature requests
- [Discord](https://discord.gg/sjrw8QXNks) - chat with the community and share ideas

We’ll update this page as soon as code and documentation contributions are possible. Thank you for your patience!
